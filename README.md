The cube furthest to the left has a dark grey color with a phong shader using a purple specular highlight (0xccaaee)
The second farthest left cube is similar, it has a slightly brighter base color, and uses toon shading instead. It's specular highlight is bright blue (0xcaefff)
The two cubes on the far right are using fragment shaders.
  - the one on top is my shader, it hard cuts between different colors depending on the position of the pixel, it's decided by a chain of ifs.
  - the one on the bottom is using the shader from the tutorial, I only changed the colors
